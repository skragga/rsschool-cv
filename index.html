    <h2> About myself: </h2>



      <p> I graduated from the Belarusian Economic University in 2015, the Faculty of Management, specializing in economics and informatics. 
          Then have been working in the field of road cargo transportation for 8 years. 4 of them I'm working in transport company in Poland, Lodz till now.
           When  I was studyind in university I had some programming classes, but now I want to learn more and dive deeper into the front-end theme. 
           I have quite good skills in Photoshop and retouching photo. 
          In my free time I am engaged in the development of a blog about makeup, I am fond of needlework, dog training. 
         I hope that I will acquire new skills that will allow me to change profession.

    <b> About myself: </b>
    </p>

    <p>
        I graduated from the Belarusian Economic University in 2010, the Faculty of Management, specializing in economics and informatics. Then have been working in the field of road cargo transportation for 8 years. 4 of them I'm working in Poland, Lodz till now. When  I was studyind in university I had some programming classes, but now I want to learn more and dive deeper into the front-end theme. I have quite good skills in Photoshop and retouching photo. 
In my free time I am engaged in the development of a blog about makeup, I am fond of needlework, dog training. 
I hope that I will acquire new skills that will allow me to change profession.
